Cypress.io Testing Demo Project
===============================

This project shows Cypress.io tools on ["RealWorld example app"](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld). We used React + Redux client + Node/Express server. Also, [Testing Workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop) project was a good inspiration for this Project

Run app
-------

0. Install node and mongo.db _(TODO: add Docker file with all the required tools)_
1. Start server
```
npm install
mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
npm run dev
```
2. Start client
```
npm install
npm start
```
